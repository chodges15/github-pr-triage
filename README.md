## Install

### Dependencies

 * python with pip
 * memcached

Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip memcached libmemcached-dev libz-dev

### Requirements

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Configure

### GitHub
Generate a GitHub oauth personal access token with `public_repo` scope using
[instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use).

### Environment

    export GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=<token>
    export MEMCACHE_URL=localhost:11211

## Run

    python app.py

point your browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Deploy

### Prepare (Optional)

You might want to make a "dist version" - a copy of the `./app` directory made
for production use. All CSS and JS is concatenated and minified correctly.
To do that you need to first:

    grymt -w ./app

That will create a directory called "./dist" which will contain an optimized
`index.html` which the server app (`app.py`) knows to serve instead.

### Stackato
You can deploy this on Stackato by simply running:

    stackato push

### Heroku

Follow standard [Heroku Python
Deployment](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#deploy-your-application-to-heroku)

Set the `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable on heroku:

    heroku config:set GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=<github-token>

Send your browser to your Heroku app:

    heroku open

### Docker

    sudo docker run --name memcached -d borja/docker-memcached
    sudo docker build -t triage .
    sudo docker run --link memcached:memcached -p 5000:5000 -e GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=<token> -d triage

### Cache invalidation Webhook

Once you have your site set up in production, you can set up a GitHub Webhook
that pings this site whenever pull requests are created or updated in some way.
What this does is that it immediately invalidates our cache so that you get
more up to date information.

To do that, go to your favorite GitHub project, click the "Settings".
Then click "Webhooks & Services". Then click the "Add Webhook" button.

Suppose you have this site set up at `http://somedomain.com/` then the
"Payload URL" you need to enter is `http://somedomain.com/webhook`.

Next, you need to select the "Let me select individual events" radio button.
When a bunch of choices are offered, check:

* Push
* Pull Request
* Issue comment
* Pull Request review comment

Make sure it's Active and then click "Add webhook".

Now it should hopefully inform the site when things change so that the cache
can quickly be invalidated.
